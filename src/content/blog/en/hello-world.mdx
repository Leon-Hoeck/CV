Welcome to my personal corner of the web! This space serves as both a showcase of my work and a platform to share my journey in development.

## Why a Blog?

In today's digital age, having an online presence is crucial, yet maintaining privacy for myself is quite important. This blog aims to strike that perfect balance by:

* Building with Next.js 14 and TypeScript to showcase modern web development
* Sharing insights about domain-based i18n routing and middleware implementations
* Documenting my experiences with server components and static generation
* Creating a space that demonstrates privacy-focused analytics with Redis
You can find the source code for this website on my <a href="https://github.com/Leon-Hoeck/Website" className="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300 transition-colors">GitHub</a>.

## What's Next?

In the upcoming posts, I'll be sharing:

* A deep dive into building this website with Next.js, including how I tackled language routing with subdomains
* Technical details about implementing privacy-focused analytics without compromising user data
* Project showcases focusing on TypeScript, React patterns, and performance optimization

Each post will aim to provide clear technical insights while maintaining a conversational style.
