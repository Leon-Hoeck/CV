Welcome to my personal corner of the web! This space serves as both a showcase of my work and a platform to share my journey in development.

## Why a Blog?

In today's digital age, having an online presence is crucial, yet maintaining privacy for myself is quite important. This blog aims to strike that perfect balance by:

* Showcasing my technical skills and projects
* Sharing insights and experiences in development
* Documenting my learning journey
* Creating a professional yet personal space

You can find the source code for this website on my <a href="https://github.com/Leon-Hoeck/Website" className="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300 transition-colors">GitHub</a>.

## What's Next?

In the upcoming posts, I'll be sharing:

* A deep dive into building this website, including the challenges faced and solutions implemented
* Technical explorations of specific technologies and approaches used
* Showcases of my projects, focusing on the technical decisions and learning outcomes

Each post will aim to provide clear descriptions while maintaining a professional writing style on the topics discussed.
